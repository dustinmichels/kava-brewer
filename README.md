Coffee words are very similar around the world: _coffee, kaffe, kava..._

It seems you can pretty much generate them using:

```text
"k" sound + vowel + "f/v" sound + vowel.
_________   _____    __________   ______
```

Here, I try to formalize the rules for making coffee words by determining a probabilistic context-free grammar [(PCFG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_context-free_grammar) from sample words.

See [notebook](https://github.com/dustinmichels/kava-brewer/blob/main/kava.ipynb).

Just for fun :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
