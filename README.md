# Kava Brewer

Coffee words are very similar around the world: _coffee, kaffe, kava..._

It seems you can pretty much generate them using:

```text
"k" sound + vowel + "f/v" sound + vowel.
_________   _____    __________   ______
```

Here, I try to formalize the rules for making coffee words by creating a probabilistic context-free grammar [(PCFG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_context-free_grammar) from sample words. A PCFCG, if you will (probabilistic context-free coffee grammar).

See [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/dustinmichels/kava-brewer/blob/main/kava.ipynb) for details.

Just for fun :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
